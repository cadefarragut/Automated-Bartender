# 🍹 Automated Bartender Project

## Overview
In collaboration with **Enginuity Global**, I worked alongside:
- **1 Electrical Engineer (EE)**
- **2 Mechanical Engineers (MEs)**

With Enginuity Global’s provided budget, our team **designed, ordered, and built** an automated bartending system capable of creating **12 unique drinks** through **PLC–HMI integration**.

## 🔧 My Role & Contributions
- **User Interface Development**  
  - Designed and implemented a **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** for intuitive drink selection.
  - Programmed system control logic in **Ladder Logic** for smooth PLC operation.

- **Electrical System Design** *(with EE teammate)*  
  - Designed wiring and power distribution systems.
  - Integrated **24V** and **12V** power supplies.
  - Installed and configured **24V fuse terminals** for circuit protection.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- **PLC Programming**: Custom Ladder Logic to manage pump sequencing, drink selection, and safety checks.
- **HMI Implementation**: Graphical interface for user input and system feedback.
- **Electrical Integration**: Power supply selection, wiring layout, and protection systems.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Mechanical design, electrical engineering, and software working together.
